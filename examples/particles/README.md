# Particles Example

The particles example was "manually forked" from the following GitHub repo:
https://github.com/doctorpartlow/esp32s3lilygoanimations/blob/main/particles.ino

I only applied a couple minor bug fixes, optimizations, and formatting.

In addition, for running on the CYD, I added touchscreen input support to move the attractor.

Here is a Youtube video posted by the original author of the their "7000 non normalized particles on the esp32-s3 t-display from lilygo" code:
